# VTrack - Vehicle Tracking System with Global Positioning System and Global System for Mobile Communications

## Introduction

The VTrack vehicle tracking system is designed to revolutionize campus vehicle management
at Gandaki University by providing real-time insights into vehicle movements. Aiming to
address the challenges faced by students due to unpredictable arrival times, VTrack offers a
range of features that include real-time location tracking, efficient route optimization, and
geo-fencing capabilities. With VTrack, users will be able to access accurate and timely
information about vehicle locations, improving overall fleet management practices. Additionally,
VTrack prioritizes driver safety and is expected to reduce operational costs associated with fleet
management. Through its innovative use of Global Positioning System [GPS] technology,
VTrack will bring significant benefits to the campus community and set a new standard in
vehicle tracking solutions.

The primary objective of the VTrack project is to provide a real-time vehicle tracking system for
campus vehicles at Gandaki University, specifically to address the issue of untimely arrival of
campus vehicles and to improve the overall campus transportation experience for students using
technology.

## Scope of the Project

1. <b style="color:red; font-size:20px;">Real-Time Location Tracking and Data Display</b>: The <b style="color:orange; font-size:16px;">core feature </b> of VTrack is to provide users with <b style="color:orange; font-size:16px;"> nearly real-time updates on the location and status of vehicles</b>. This includes displaying the real-time location of the vehicle at specific bus stations and updating the user's feed as vehicles pass through each checkpoint. The system aims to ensure that users can view the bus on a map, enhancing the accessibility and convenience of tracking vehicles.

2. <b style="color:red; font-size:20px;">Geo-Fencing Capabilities and User Alerts</b>: A significant aspect of VTrack is its <b style="color:orange; font-size:16px;">geo-fencing feature</b>, which allows users to set virtual boundaries and receive alerts when vehicles enter or exit designated areas. This functionality is crucial for enhancing the safety and management of the fleet, providing users with timely notifications about vehicle movements relative to predefined geographical zones.

3. <b style="color:red; font-size:20px;">User Interface and Accessibility Features</b>: VTrack will offer a web-based application with a user-friendly interface, showcasing the real-time location of vehicles and enabling users to search for specific vehicles using criteria like plate number or driverâ€™s name. The application will be accessible to students and staff with unique identification numbers, ensuring secure access while minimizing potential risks. The backend and database management will be powered by <b style="color:orange; font-size:16px;">Google Firebase</b>, supporting the system's infrastructure and data handling needs.
